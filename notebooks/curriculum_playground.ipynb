      " What is JavaScript?  \n",
      "Javascript  is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and \n",
      "most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementati ons allow \n",
      "client -side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.  It is an \n",
      "interpreted programming language with object -oriented capabilities .  \n",
      "JavaScript was first known as LiveScript , but Netscape changed its name  to \n",
      "JavaScript , possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. \n",
      "JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the \n",
      "name  LiveScript . The general -purpose core of the language has been \n",
      "embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and oth er web browsers . \n",
      "The ECMA -262 Specification  defined a standard version of the core JavaScript \n",
      "language.  \n",
      " JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language . \n",
      " Designed for creating network -centric applications . \n",
      " Complementary to and integrated with Java . \n",
      " Complementary to and integrated with HTML . \n",
      " Open and cross -platform . \n",
      "Client -Side JavaScript  \n",
      "Client -side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The scrip t \n",
      "should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be \n",
      "interpreted by the browser.  \n",
      "It means that a web page need no t be a static HTML, but can include programs \n",
      "that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create H TML \n",
      "content.  \n",
      "The JavaScript client -side mechanism provides  many advantages over traditional \n",
      "CGI server -side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the \n",
      "user has entered a valid e -mail address in a form field.  \n",
      "The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all \n",
      "the entries are valid , they would be submitted to the Web Server.  \n",
      "JavaScript can be used to trap user -initiated events such as button clicks, link \n",
      "navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly .  1. OVERVIEW   \n",

      "One of the  most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the \n",
      "set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be \n",
      "represented and manipulated in a programming language.  \n",
      "JavaScript allows you to w ork with three primitive data types:  \n",
      " Numbers , e.g., 123, 120.50 etc.  \n",
      " Strings  of text , e.g. \"This text string\" etc.  \n",
      " Boolean , e.g. true or false.  \n",
      "JavaScript also defines two trivial data types,  null and undefined , each of \n",
      "which defines only a single value.  In addition to these primitive data types, \n",
      "JavaScript supports a composite data type known as  object . We will cover \n",
      "object s in detail in a separate chapter.  \n",
      "Note:  Java does not make a distinction between integer values and floating -\n",
      "point values. All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating -point values. \n",
      "JavaScript represents numbers using the 64 -bit floating -point format defined by \n",
      "the IEEE 754 standard.  \n",
      "JavaScript Variables  \n",
      "Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Var iables \n",
      "can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers \n",
      "and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.  \n",
      "Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables \n",
      "are declared with the  var keyword as follows.  \n",
      "<script type=\"text/javascript\">  \n",

      "Semicolons are Optional  \n",

      "You can place the <script>  tags, containing your JavaScript , anywhere within \n",
      "you web page , but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within \n",
      "the <head>  tags. \n",
      "The <script> tag alert s the browser program to start interpreting all the text \n",
      "between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear  as \n",
      "follows.  \n",
      "<script ...>  \n",

      " Type:  This attribu te is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting \n",

      " 2. SYNTAX  \n",
      "Javascript  \n",
      "64 \n",
      " \n",
      " A function is a group  of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your \n",
      "program. This eliminates the need of wr iting the same code again and again. It \n",
      "helps programmers in writing modular code s. Functions allow a programmer to \n",
      "divide a big program in to a number of small and manageable functions.  \n",
      "Like any other advance d programming language,  JavaScript also supports all the \n",
      "features necessary to write modular code using functions.  You must have seen \n",
      "functions like  alert () and write () in the earlier chapters. We were using these \n",
      "function s again and again , but they ha d been wri tten in core JavaScript only \n",
      "once.  \n",
      "JavaScript allows us to write our own functions as well. This section explain s \n",
      "how to write your own functions in JavaScript.  \n",
      "Function Definition  \n",
      "Before we use a function , we need to define it. The most common way to define \n",
      "a function in JavaScript is by using the function  keyword, followed by a unique \n",
      "function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement \n",
      "block surrounded by curly braces.  \n",
      "Syntax  \n",
      "The basic syntax is shown here . \n",
      "<script type=\"text/javascript\">  \n",
      "<!-- \n",
      "function functionname(parameter -list) \n",
      "{ \n",
      "  statements  \n",
      "} \n",
      "//--> \n",
      "</script>  \n",
      "Example  \n",
      "Try the following example . It defines a function called sayHello that  takes no \n",
      "parameters :  \n",
      " 13. FUNCTIONS  \n",
      "Javascript  \n",
      "7 \n",
      " \n",
      " But when formatted in a single line as follows, you must use semicolons :  \n",
      "<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">  \n",
      "<!-- \n",
      "  var1 = 10; var2 = 20;  \n",
      "//--> \n",
      "</script>  \n",
      "Note:  It is a good programming practice to use semicolons.  \n",
      "Case Sensitivity  \n",
      "JavaScript is a case -sensitive language. This means that the language keywords, \n",
      "variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a \n",
      "consistent capitalization of letters.  \n",
      "So the identifiers  Time  and TIME  will convey  different meanings in JavaScript.  \n",
      "NOTE:  Care should be taken while writing variable and function names in \n",
      "JavaScript.  \n",
      "Comments in JavaScript  \n",
      "JavaScript supports both C -style and C++ -style comments . Thus: \n",
      " Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and \n",
      "is ignored by JavaScript.  \n",
      " Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This \n",
      "may span multiple lines.  \n",
      " JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence <! --. \n",
      "JavaScript treats this as a single -line comment, just as it does the // \n",
      "comment.  \n",
      " The HTML comment closing sequence --> is not recognized by JavaScript \n",
      "so it should be written as // -->. \n",
